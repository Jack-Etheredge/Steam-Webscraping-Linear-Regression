# Steam-Webscraping-Linear-Regression
I scraped Steam and steamDB data for every video game available for purchase through Steam and then performed linear regression to predict the number of concurrent users. This was done using Selenium and Python. Many Python packages were used including pandas, seaborn, stats models, scikitlearn, fuzzywuzzy.

I used a combination of Selenium webdriving and beautiful soup to scrape the data.

Variables collected for each videogame included:
Price
Discounted Price
Number of overall reviews
Number of recent reviews
Percentage of positive overall reviews
Percentage of positive recent reviews
ESRB Rating
